# XVA1-dual-synth-hardware-editor

A new version of the MacMannes hardware editor that can control two XVA1 modules and copy patches between them. This allows a dual synthesizer with layers/spits etc.

I took the unfinished (due to illness) XVA1 hardware editor by MacMannes and doubled the displays and encoders and added a save facility for your edits.

It runs on a Teensy 3.6 and the rest of the hardware is similar to the original

It's not completed due to the war in my country but is more functional than the original except for the envelope displays

If it receives a program changes over MIDI and sends them onto the XVA1 synth over serial to call up the patch and recall the data into the editor.

Lots of things to improve on in the future in more peaceful times.

Has an upper and lower button to select which synth your are editing and saves the program into either synth.

-Things to do

Add a performance mode to mix patches and store to SD card on the controller
